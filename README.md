🚀 Hands-Free Instagram Reels Scrolling? Why Not! 😎

Ever felt too lazy to scroll through reels while chilling back? Well, I did—so I built a hand gesture-controlled reel scroller! ✨

Using MediaPipe + OpenCV, I created a fun personal project that lets me scroll reels with just my hand gestures—no need to touch the screen! 🤯

This wasn’t just for fun (okay, maybe a little 😆), but also a cool way to explore computer vision and hand tracking while solving a daily-life “problem” in the laziest way possible.

🔧 Tech Stack: Python | OpenCV | MediaPipe | PyAutoGUI
🎯 Use Case: Sit back, relax, and let your hand do the scrolling!

Now, I just need to build a bot that likes and comments for me... any ideas? 🤔😆
